1.  Are all changes during a day recorded as deltas for the end of day rollup? Or only first and last values? e.g. if a single attribute in a document has its value changed 3 times during one day, can the second value be restored via the history in the dashboard? Or can only the value from the start of the day be recovered?

2.  For the purposes of data patching, how easy is it to instantiate a copy of a database or set of documents from an earlier point in time? e.g. An update has set all attributes for accessed documents to a common value. How do we restore a second copy of the database at a point in time preceding the update to patch the attribute without losing any changes to the other attributes?

3.  Can we restore the database or a document to any point in time during the day before the end of day roll up of deltas?

4. Some questions on roll-ups:
 

    Are we able to configure a roll up policy to stagger our recoverability timeframe options? Can we configure our roll-ups so to provide a recovery framework (similar to the a Tivoli TSM expiry policy) e.g.
    Today – 7 days: End of day backup available
    Today – (7 days to 1 month): End of week backup available
    Today – (1 month to 7 years): End of month backup available

 

    Given a considerable disk cost associated with retaining end of day backups without rolling up to week and higher backup sets. 
    Is there any formula to enable us to calculate the storage volumes for different recovery granularity scenarios?
